  <article class="post-content">
    <p><span>Coding period of <span>GSoC</span> 2010 officially ended 16<span>th. </span>I was able to release the new stable version of the <span>OpenOffice</span> Plug-in on that day. So it’s time to have a look back on what I did for the past 4+ months and discuss about the issues I met.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>Look back</strong></p>
<p>The proposal for the development had following tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li><span> Supporting <span>OpenOffice</span>.org 3.0 – 3.1.</span></li>
<li> Adding support for CC0.</li>
<li> Adding support for Draw.</li>
<li> User Interface Improvements.
<ul>
<li> Adding references to important pages like FAQ and About.</li>
<li> Provide help around what each option means ("what is Share Alike").</li>
<li> Display license information when opening CC licensed documents.</li>
<li> Other improvements for the UI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Speed up the first time license insertion process.</li>
<li> Support for Internationalization.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>I started working on the project since mid April. Moving the co<span>de</span> base to <span>OpenOffice</span>.org 3.1 SDK was easy. I also updated the other libraries to their newest version. Then I tried to implement the Draw support. I found that implementation for Draw should be same as the implementation for Impress. So adding Draw support was fairly easy, but I had some problem wi<span>th</span> the page sizes. The available co<span>de</span> did not <span>conceder</span> about the page sizes and the margins. The next problem was; the visible license notice was added to the master page of the Draw/Impress document like a background of an Impress document. Therefore the user can not arrange the notice as he wants.</span></p>
<p><span>While I fixing those issues, Nathan asked me to have a look at the <span>Flickr</span> Image Re-Use plug-in. Then I started look at it and integrating its functionality to the CC plug-in. I had to update the API wrappers for the <span>Flickr</span> plug-in to make it working. Then I started using that co<span>de</span> to add image reuse support for Open Clip Art. I also improved the loading time of the <span>Flickr</span> dialog.</span></p>
<p><span>Then I started RDF adding RDF <span>Metadata</span> in the document. Currently this works only in Writer documents, because <span>OpenOffice</span>.org currently supports adding RDF only for writer documents. Then I get back to improve the image insertion I added <span>Wikimedia</span> Commons and Picasa for that. So the users can now add images using four well known image sharing sites; <span>Flickr</span>, Picasa, <span>Wikimedia</span> Commons and Open Clip Art.</span></p>
<p>The next thing I did is the UI improvement and adding public domain tools. Those two things were carried in parallel. After discussing with my mentors Nathan and Christopher we decided to use a tabbed window. This will make the licensing less confusing and easy to use.</p>
<p><span>Next was the internationalization phase. I used the existing i18n repository to add some translations to the licensing dialog, but still there are new strings available in the dialog that should be added to <span>Transifex</span>. Hope those new strings will added in the future. These translations files (.<span>po</span> files) need to be converted to Java resource bundles (internationalization method used in Java). The source folder includes a script for this, and the instructions can be found in the README.</span></p>
<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<p>For the last few weeks I was testing and trying to find out the issues related to the plug-in.</p>
<p><span>Though the new version released as a stable release, there are some problems which actually out of our control. This plug-in will not work in Mac OS Leopard where Java 64bit is the default; this is a known issue in <span>OpenOffice</span>.org. In additions to that, Mac OS X also have a problem in displaying AWT windows (issue </span><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=92926">92926</a>). I am still trying to see whether there is anything I can do.</p>
<p><span>The next issue is wi<span>th</span> Linux. We tested the plug-in in Debian and <span>Ubuntu,</span> in bo<span>th</span> cases if the plug-in is installed through the extension manager, the menus either become gray or they will not be available at all. This issue is most probably a problem in 9.10 and 10.04 because the plug-in worked well in <span>Ubuntu</span> 9.04 and Windows. I am glad to say that I have found a workaround for this. If the plug-in installed using the terminal there will not be any problem. Users can use bo<span>th</span> CLI and GUI versions of the <span>unopkg</span> (Extension manager).</span></p>
<p>To use the CLI version run</p>
<pre><span>/<span>usr</span>/lib/<span>openoffice</span>/program/<span>unopkg</span> -f <span>ccooo</span>.<span>oxt</span></span></pre>
<p>and for the GUI version use</p>
<pre><span>/<span>usr</span>/lib/<span>openoffice</span>/program/<span>unopkg</span> <span>gui</span> -f <span>ccooo</span>.<span>oxt</span></span></pre>
<p><span>Actually this is not an issue of the plug-in itself it should be a problem wi<span>th</span> <span>Ubuntu</span>. Similar plug-ins likeOoo2<span>GDand</span> Open Cards are also affected by this problem.</span><br />
I tested this plug-in in Windows and Linux in both x86 and x86-64 versions and it work without any problem (in Linux with the workaround).</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>The plug-in can be found in the <a href="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/ccooo">extension repository</a>. Alternatively you can direct download from <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/gsoc/2010/ccooo.oxt">here</a>.</p>
<p><span>Windows users can simply install it by double clicking the <span>plug-in</span>. <span>Ubuntu</span> (may be other Linux users also) need to install it trough the terminal using</span></p>
<pre><span>/<span>usr</span>/lib/<span>openoffice</span>/program/<span>unopkg</span> <span>gui</span> -f <span>ccooo</span>.<span>oxt</span></span></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><span>/<span>usr</span>/lib/<span>openoffice</span>/program/<span>unopkg</span> -f <span>ccooo</span>.<span>oxt</span></span></pre>
<p><strong>Source</strong></p>
<p>The source code of the plug-in can be found at <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewsvn/ccooo/branches/akila-gsoc-2010/"><span>http://co<span>de</span>.<span>creativecommons</span>.org/<span>viewsvn</span>/<span>ccooo</span>/branches/<span>akila</span>-<span>gsoc</span>-2010/</span></a></p>
<p><span>Comments and <span>Feedbacks</span></span></p>
<p><span>While I was searching the Internet to find more issues related to the <span>plug-in</span>, I found some blog posts and comments about the <span>plug-in</span>. I have listed them below.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.golem.de/1007/76211.html"><span>http://www.<span>golem</span>.<span>de</span>/1007/76211.html</span></a><br />

<p><span>All of these <span>feedbacks</span> were good, except the Mac OS X issue. I am trying to fix it as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>To add new <span>feedbacks</span>, users can use the extension page at extension repository. Still there can be issues related to the plug-in. Those issues and feature requests can be added to the CC issues list.</span><br />
<strong><br />
Future Features</strong></p>
<p><span>Nathan suggested a feature for <span>Flickr</span>; to extract add images from a given URL. So users can copy and paste the URL to <span>OpenOffice</span>.org and the plug-in will automatically download the image and add licensing data also. This can be used for others services also.</span></p>
<p>In addition to that localization should be completed.</p>
<p>This is time time to thank all the people who helped me in achieving this. I should thank the following people specially for helping me;</p>
<ul>
<li><span> <strong>Nathan <span>Yergler</span></strong>: for helping me wi<span>th</span> good suggestions in the <span>pre</span> <span>GSoC</span> period and in the community bonding period.</span></li>
<li><span> <strong>Christopher Allan <span>Webber</span></strong>: for mentoring me in this process and for all the good suggestions he gave.</span></li>
<li><span> <strong>Nathan <span>Kinkade</span></strong>: for helping wi<span>th</span> the SVN issues (yes I had some :)).</span></li>
<li><span> <strong>Alex Roberts and Greg <span>Grossmeier</span></strong>: for their valuable suggestions in making the GUI.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Now it is the time to rip off the “test” part from the plug-in name “Creative Commons Licensing (test)” :). The plug-in was released for beta testing since May 2010 and it was downloaded more than 400 times. But making a perfect program is impossible thing. So I appreciate if the users can report any issues and suggestions as I mentioned in the Feedback section. I will always try to fix/implement them.</p>
<p>More information about the plug-in and the screen shots are available in the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OpenOfficeOrg_Addin">wiki</a> page.</p>
