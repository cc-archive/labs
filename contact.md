## There are a few ways to get in touch with CC Labs.

* IRC: #creativecommons-dev on Freenode. See [CC's wiki](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/IRC) for more details on other IRC channels for CC.

* Send us a bug report. Generally, filing them against the [main CC.org repo](https://github.com/creativecommons/creativecommons.org/issues) is preferred, but if there's a bug with another project, report it there. You'll know what to do.

* Join the CC development mailing list. This is unfortunately broken. In early 2015, we're moving to our own self-hosted GNU Mailman instance to overcome this problem.

* Email us. webmaster at the main Creative Commons domain, or mattl at the same place. You choose.

### Contacting Matt

* Follow me on GNU social or Twitter: @mattl (with a self hosted GNU social at <https://mattl.io>)

* In person. If you're in the Boston, MA area or elsewhere. Let me know. I travel a fair amount to San Francisco, but also to Europe and other places in the US.

I'm available to come talk about CC tech work at your event.

### Contacting Rob

* Follow me on GNU social or Twitter: @robmyers (for GNU social I'm on [quitter.se](https://quitter.se/robmyers)).

* In person. If you're in the Vancouver, BC area or elsewhere. Let me know. I travel less than Matt but I love meeting up with people when I do.
