Welcome to the new look CC labs website. Our previous site hadn't been
updated in about two years, so I'm back with some regular updates on
what we're doing at CC.

The plan is to update the blog three times a week &mdash; Monday will
give an update on what we're working on. Wednesday will give an update
on our infrastructure work, hopefully sharing some useful tips, and on
Friday I'd like to set a potential idea for a weekend hack project.

Plus, somewhere along the way I'll share other things, like neat
pieces of free software I come across or things related to our
work.

This site is in Jekyll, and [you can fork it on GitHub](https://github.com/creativecommons/labs), or send
improvements and fixes.
