<p>Next week is <a href="http://mozillaservice.org">Mozilla Service Week</a> and Creative Commons is participating by hosting a week long help desk in <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/IRC">IRC</a>.  You can find more details on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17450">earlier blog post</a> or <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Mozilla_Service_Week">in the wiki</a>.  Several CC staff members and community volunteers will be available during the week to answer questions about using CC licenses and the associated tools.  We'll be answering questions about:</p>
<ul>
<li>General CC help</li>
<li>CC technology (ccREL and software projects)</li>
<li>Where and how to publish CC works</li>
<li>Where and how to find CC works</li>
<li>CC in education and science </li>
</ul>
<p>If you'd like to help out and educate others about using CC licenses and tools, you can sign up on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Mozilla_Service_Week#Volunteers">wiki page</a>.  </p>
