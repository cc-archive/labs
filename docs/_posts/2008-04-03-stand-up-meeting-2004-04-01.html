<p>The Tech Team at Creative Commons has recently replaced our weekly one-on-ones (myself with each direct report) with semi-weekly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting">stand-up meetings</a> for the entire team.  Note that we're not really agile "purists" -- our meeting involve some discussion of priorities, etc, either for the week ahead, or as a recap of the week past.</p>
<p>From Tuesday's meeting:</p>
