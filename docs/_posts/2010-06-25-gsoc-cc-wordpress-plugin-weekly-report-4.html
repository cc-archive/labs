As some of you may have noticed, this report about the <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/05/24/gsoc-project-introduction-cc-wordpress-plugin/">Wordpress <abbr title="Creative Commons">CC</abbr> plugin</a> is several days late. This is because I was unable to produce new substantial features and have hit a roadblock with the one that is most important right now: A filter.</p>
<p>
In its current state, the plugin works fairly straightforward; it generates the markup and inserts it into the post. When planning it, I thought that would suffic â€” however, Nathan Kinkade advised me that several use cases would break this simple behaviour: If, for example, the chosen license is changed, there is no way to update all posts containing the already generated markup.</p>
<p>
The solution lies in an intermediate form of markup that gets applied every time a page containing cc-licensed media is generated. My current approach looks like this: <code>[[cc:18]]</code> (where 18 is the id of the image/audio/video). This should get converted to the already known <abbr title="Resource Description Framework in Attributes">RDFa</abbr>-enriched <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>; currently, however, a bug in my code apparently makes Wordpress return a blank page whenever I activate that filter.</p>
<p>
On a related note, someone in <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#swig">#swig on FreeNode</a> advised me to look at <i>Oshani Seneviratne</i>s <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2009/Clipboard/">semantic clipboard</a>; as I can tell, it would go together nicely with my plugin.</p>
