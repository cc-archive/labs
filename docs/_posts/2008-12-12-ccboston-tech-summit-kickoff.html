<p>CC board member <a title="Hal Abelson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Abelson" target="_blank">Hal Abelson</a> kicked off today's Boston tech summit with a brief history of where CC tech has been, and where CC tech is going.</p>
<p>Where the licenses provide interoperability for legal code, the interoperability for technologies has taken longer to develop. <a title="RDFa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa" target="_blank">RDFa</a>, which allows for distributed embedding of metadata in web pages, has been accepted as a W3C recommendation. CC and others are developing inherently distributed technologies that are inherently extensible. Clearly interoperability is the name of the game.</p>
<p>Hal also touted the as-yet-unreleased book <a title="Viral Spiral" href="http://www.amazon.com/Viral-Spiral-Commoners-Digital-Republic/dp/1595583963/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229093722&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Viral Spiral: how the commoners built a digital republic of their own</a> as a story of what we have accomplished, and what more is possible.</p>
