<p>Terry Hancock, a frequent poster on the law-oriented cc-licenses list, is working on an interesting metadata library called <a href="http://light-princess.org/palimpsest/">Palimpsest</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hich has a mnemonic association with what the program does, and does have a clever backronym for those who want one:<br />
<strong>P</strong>ython<br />
<strong>A</strong>ttribution &amp;<br />
<strong>L</strong>icensing<br />
<strong>I</strong>nformation<br />
<strong>M</strong>etadata<br />
<strong>P</strong>rocessor, with<br />
<strong>S</strong>ystematic<br />
<strong>E</strong>xtensibility for<br />
<strong>S</strong>undry<br />
<strong>T</strong>ypes</p></blockquote>
<p>Terry's goals for the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read/write support of Adobe XMP embedded metadata</li>
<li>Read/write support of native â€œnamed fieldâ€ data</li>
<li>Read/write support of comments</li>
<li>Read/write support of visible text labelling for formats that need it</li>
<li>General adaptation to the 15 Dublin Core named fields for all data</li>
<li>Discovery of attribution and licensing data in comments and annotations, if not available elsewhere</li>
<li>License-aware processing (expansion of common abbreviations of terms, etc)</li>
<li>Open-ended pluggable support for virtually any multimedia datatype</li>
<li>Highly portable, so that it can be used on clients or servers on any operating system</li>
<li>Dead-simple, so people will actually want to <em>use</em> it</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm glad to see Terry tackling this project. It'll be hard to get the abstractions right, but valuable if it works.</p>
<p>I love the project logo:<br />
<a href="http://light-princess.org/palimpsest/" title="Palimpsest logo"><img src="img/pal_logo.jpg" alt="Palimpsest logo" /></a><br />
Not because it is a particularly great logo, but because it's the first logo I've seen that could be mistaken for a captcha. Intentional or not, bound to be independently invented many times, and perhaps copied by me at least once.</p>
