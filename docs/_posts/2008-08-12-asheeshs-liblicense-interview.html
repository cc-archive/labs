<p>Relatively to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8748">liblicense 0.8 announcement</a>, I recently made a video interview of Asheesh concerning his work on <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Liblicense">liblicense</a>.</p>
<p>Watch it <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1142312/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In his demo, Asheesh uses liblicense twice:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the online photo gallery to read and write metadata</li>
<li>in the Eye Of Gnome plug-in to read license metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>This shows that liblicense is now mature enough to be used by your applications.</p>
