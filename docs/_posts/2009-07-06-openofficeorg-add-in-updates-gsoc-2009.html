<p>I've been working on the GSoC 2009 project, where I'm working on certain updates to the existing Creative Commons Add-in for OpenOffice.org. This project is mentored by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#31">Nathan Yergler</a>.</p>
<p>The main goals for this project is to provide the following updates to the existing plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the codebase to the OOo 3 SDK</li>
<li>The license selection UI could be refined to provide help around what each option means (”what is Share Alike”).</li>
<li>Display license information when opening CC licensed documents</li>
<li>Internationalization – prepare the code for translation and write the scripts to integrate PO files prepared by translators</li>
<li>Support for OOo Draw</li>
<li>Add support for CC0</li>
<li>Make a release incorporating Flickr Image Re-Use for OpenOffice.org.</li>
</ul>
<p>As there are many distinct tasks, I'm working on complete the most I can. I have been struggling a bit in the past couple of weeks with my progress, but I'm now bouncing back and coming back to track.</p>
<p>I hope I'll be able to present the CC community with an updated version of the Add-in at the end of the project completion.</p>
