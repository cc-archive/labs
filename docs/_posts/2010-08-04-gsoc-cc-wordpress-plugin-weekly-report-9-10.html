Time is running out for work on the <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/05/24/gsoc-project-introduction-cc-wordpress-plugin/">plugin</a>. With the 9th of this month being the suggested date to start working on documentation and cleanup and the 16th being a definitive "pencils down" date, I'm definitely in a hurry. Here's my story for the last two weeks, decorated with nicely drawn bullet points:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> elements are <i>inline blocks</i> now</b>: Like the elements they are supposed to replace — <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and the occasional <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> — <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> elements should not disturb the flow of a blog post. They also now display effortless besides each other.
</li>
<li><b>The <i>wetter</i> style became less <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>-centric</b>: I created a version of the stylesheet with a crossed-out Euro symbol (€).<br />

</li>
<li><b>No more shortcodes</b>: The plugin now inserts simple image, video or audio elements and uses the PHP <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> facilities to detect and replace them. For error-tolerant parsing, I use the MIT-licensed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/"><i>html5lib</i></a>.</li>
<li><b>Some IE 6/7 support</b>: After discovering older versions of Internet Explorer are unable to style new HTML5 elements, I came upon Remy Sharp's <a href="http://html5doctor.com/how-to-get-html5-working-in-ie-and-firefox-2/">javascript-based workaround</a>. Granted, some parts still looks like crap in IE, but that is what you get for using a browser that is older than dirt.</li>
<li><b>New <i>hybrid</i> style</b>: <img src="img/hybrid.png" alt="screenshot of hybrid style, showing a dark bar with light text" /></li>
<li><b>Locale and jurisdiction support</b>: Both can now be set in the admin interface, each media item can have a separate jurisdiction. All information comes from the excellent <a href="http://api.creativecommons.org/docs/readme_dev.html">CC REST API</a>. See for yourself:<br />

</ul>
<p>
Two very important things are still missing: A cache for API responses and an easy method for re-embedding. I am going to work on those (and everything else Nathan Kinkade digs up in this version) in the next few days.</p>
<p>
The overly frequent API calls result in notable slowness interface-wise and unneccessary load on the server side — so kids, don't try this at home! You have been warned.</p>
