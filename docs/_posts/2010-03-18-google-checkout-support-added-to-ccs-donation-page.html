<p>A number of months ago CC launched <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2009/11/09/one-click-paypal-donations-with-civicrm/">a simplification</a> of the donation process on the <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">CC contribution page</a>.  At that time, only PayPal was supported, but I'm happy to announce that Google Checkout support was recently integrated.    The only change to the actual interface is that now a query string variable of <strong>&pp=</strong> (pp = payment processor) is required.</p>
