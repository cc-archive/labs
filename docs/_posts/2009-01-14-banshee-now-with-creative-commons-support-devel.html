<p>Great news from <a href="http://gburt.blogspot.com/">Gabriel Burt</a>, lead developer for the Open Source media player <a href="http://banshee-project.org/">Banshee</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Search based on the license of a song/album with direct support of displaying CC license logos!</strong></p>
<p>More details available on <a href="http://gburt.blogspot.com/2009/01/catching-up.html">Gabriel's blog post</a>.</p>
<p>This feature is slated to be in Banshee 1.6 but you can play with Gabriel's development branch which has this feature thanks to the beauty of git.</p>
<p><code>git clone <a href="http://banshee-project.org/~gburt/banshee.git">http://banshee-project.org/~gburt/banshee.git</a></code></p>
<p>Technical notes of the feature: Gabriel wrote his own parser for extracting the license information from the files.  That was needed because there is currently not a Mono port of <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/liblicense">liblicense</a>, a library which reads and writes license metadata to a wide variety of files.  But now if anyone wants to help out and do the port to Mono you have an example of how to access this information via Mono.</p>
<p>Lets keep this ball rolling and get license read/write support in more applications!</p>
