<p><a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> is an amazing web framework; we built a lot of features in a very short period of time and Django [mostly] stayed out of our way. Last night as I was working on today's feature upgrade for <a href="http://creativecommons.net">creativecommons.net</a> I decided to tackle what lots of people see as its major weakness: schema migration. Rather, the lack of an integrated migration story.</p>
<p>I had seen some of the tools floating around and decided to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSq8m00p1FM">the panel from Djangocon</a> to get a better overview.  For the record the represented tools are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/">dmigrations</a>, <a href="http://south.aeracode.org/">south</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-evolution/">django-evolution</a>. At some point while watching the video I think I was convinced each was the right solution; they all have features/use cases to recommend them.</p>
<p>Selecting the correct tool is an exercise in change management: it seems almost certain that Django will eventually adopt or create a "blessed" migration tool.  And at that point, we need a way to move forward. Because of this I wound up choosing dmigrations.  Sure, it doesn't do some of the fancy stuff that south and django-evolution do (dependency tracking, model "fingerprinting") but it does let us dump out the entire migration path as raw SQL and that's something I can easily work with when it comes time to recreate our database on the "real' platform.</p>
