<p>Not that I am expecting much trouble coding using the Geo-IP module, but trying to get it on to the system itself has me believing that this module is out to get me! First, mac OS X (Leopard) doesn't come with GCC installed (shocker!) and this module needs building, so I go to get it. GCC is in packaged in with the developers tool, which is about a 2 GB install and I can't hand-pick the components ... fail. So I go get myself darwin ports, and try that route. It installs, gives me the sweet *ding*, install complete sound and when I go to terminal and ... fail ... no such file or directory. So I give in to its terrorist demands and make room for the developers pack thinking I'll make up for it by actually using these tools. So I wait 19 minutes for it to complete installing, I check I have GCC [i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1] ... happily I go and python setup.py build ... and what followed was not nice ... a screen full of Warnings and Errors and No Build. =(</p>
<p>I am going to find another source and try again till it finally works!</p>
<p>In other news, changing all my codes to methods and including append to file for results, looking to add file-list comparison as a feature. Coming soon to a GIT repository near you!</p>
