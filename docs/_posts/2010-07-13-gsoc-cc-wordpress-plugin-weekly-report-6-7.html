One week ago, my laptop's harddisk broke down during the afternoon. I had been accustomed to occasional data loss before — sometimes, pictures would be garbled and on one incident, a 100 <abbr title="Megabyte">MB</abbr> sound file was corrupted and could not be copied. However, as the kernel printed unpleasant warnings during <em>every</em> startup, aborting the normal boot process, insisting that the file system was damaged, I decided it was the proper time to panic and check the backups.</p>
<p>
Getting a replacement drive took me several days. As I did not have money to spare, my first hurdle was activating the <abbr title="Google Summer of Code">GsoC</abbr> prepaid card.  To make it short, I was not able to activate the card using the error-prone web site, but succeeded in doing it by phone. When I finally held the new hard drive in my hands, I felt like an <abbr title="Role-Playing Game">RPG</abbr> character, who had in a side quest acquired the item necessary to continue his main endeavour; on sunday, almost all backups were applied.</p>
<p>
Regarding the <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/05/24/gsoc-project-introduction-cc-wordpress-plugin/">plugin</a>, I have fixed a number of small bugs and also added several new features, listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Default licensing</b>: Users can now choose a license that gets applied to every attachment if they do not choose a specific license.</li>
<li><b>Post thumbnail figures</b>: <a href="http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2009/12/23/new-in-wordpress-2-9-post-thumbnail-images/">Wordpress post thumbnails</a> can now be embedded as figures with annotated markup, just like inline content. Since many theme authors do not properly filter the markup returned by the Wordpress function <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_post_thumbnail"><code>the_post_thumbnail()</code></a> (and similar ones), expecting only an <i>&lt;img&gt;</i> element, this option is disabled by default.</li>
<li><b>Fallback links for multimedia content</b>: <i>&lt;audio&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;video&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;object&gt;</i> elements now sport a fallback link for browsers that do not support <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5.</li>
<li><b>Support for alternate content and plugin directories</b>: Since Wordpress 2.6, you can change the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Determining_Plugin_and_Content_Directories">names of the <i>wp-content</i> and <i>plugins</i> directories</a>; earlier versions of the plugin did not cope with that. I had struggled with this issue before, but after <i>Moritz Metz</i> provided a working default configuration for <i>wp-config.php</i>, everything fell into place fast.</li>
<li><b>New stylesheet</b>: I modified the existing <i>grau</i> style, using <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_icons#Small_Buttons">80×15 icons</a>. I am pondering setting it as the standard stylesheet for the plugin. This is how it looks: <img src="img/grau-icon-css.png" /></li>
</ul>
<p>
For this week, I will focus on making default licensing more expansive, adding differing license options for different types of media content and maybe even for single users. I will also try to modify the existing stylesheets so they work well with post thumbnail figures. As <i>Nathan Kinkade</i> suggested, I may expand the scope of the plugin to also manage licensing metadata of pages and posts.</p>
