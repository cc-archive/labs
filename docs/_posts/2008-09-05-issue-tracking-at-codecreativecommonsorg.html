<p>Continuing the trend started when we <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2008/04/01/version-control-changes/">moved our source repository</a>, today we're rolling out <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/issues">issue tracking on code.creativecommons.org</a>.  Our goals are two fold:</p>
<ol>
<li> Increase transparency regarding what we are doing and plan to do.  If you find a bug or suggest an idea, we'd like to make sure it's tracked in a publicly accessible location where everyone can follow along.</li>
<li>Tangentially, we'd like to make it easier for people to contribute to the work we're doing.  We [semi-]frequently hear people say they'd like to help, but don't know where to start.  We've had <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer_Challenges">Developer Challenges</a> forever but they're not easy to find and poorly maintained.  I'm personally hoping that keeping the ideas in the same system we [developers] use every day will keep them in the forefront of our minds.</li>
</ol>
<p>With respect to the first, we're initially tracking bugs here for three projects: the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license">license engine</a>, Herder (a translation tool we'll be rolling out real soon now), and CC Learn's <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/projects/oesearch">Universal Education Search</a> project.  Feel free to create bugs, wishes, features for any CC project; we'll create the Project identifiers as we go.</p>
<p>With respect to challenges, I've created a <strong><code>community</code></strong> keyword we'll assign to projects that it's unlikely we'll tackle, but which might be appropriate for someone in the community who wants to contribute. <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/">Luis'</a> <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/2008/09/03/creative-commons-picture-script-request/">idea</a> from earlier this week is the <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/issues/issue7">first</a>. I hope we have a giant pile of ideas (and a corresponding giant pile of completed ideas) by next year's Summer of Code.</p>
