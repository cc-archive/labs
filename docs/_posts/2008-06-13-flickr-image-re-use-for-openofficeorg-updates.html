<p>I`m happy to announce that i succeeded in doing, in a basic manner, all the 3 requirements for this project : search photos by tags, by license and to insert one photo into a document.</p>
<p>Here you have a screenshot made after a search was done on tag <strong>mountains </strong> and license <strong>Attribution License</strong> :</p>
<p><a href="http://techblog.creativecommons.org/files/2008/06/ccflickr1.JPG" title="Results after a search on a tag and a license"><img src="img/ccflickr1.JPG" alt="Results after a search on a tag and a license" /></a></p>
<p>Also here you have the screenshot with the photo inserted into a <a href="http://techblog.creativecommons.org/files/2008/06/ccflickr2.JPG" title="Photo">document </a>. As you can see the image was inserted with a default size, but this will be changed later.</p>
<p>What i`ll try to do next :</p>
<ul>
<li>add menus to each image with the available sizes</li>
<li>improve the searching</li>
<li>inserting the image into the document with the selected size</li>
<li>adding the license into the document</li>
<li>more testing</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope, that in less than 2 weeks i will make available a good version.</p>
<p>Any comments or suggestions are well appreciated.</p>
<p>ps : I came across this <a href="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/2008_google_summer_code_21_projects_im_excited_about" title="2008_google_summer_code_21_projects_im_excited_about">article</a>. "I for one canâ€™t wait." says <a href="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/user/37372" title="Andrew Min">Andrew Min</a> about this project. I`ll try to not disappoint him :)</p>
