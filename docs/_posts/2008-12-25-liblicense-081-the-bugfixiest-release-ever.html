<p>I'm greatly pleased to announce liblicense 0.8.1.  Steren and Greg found a number of major issues (Greg found a consistent crasher on amd64, and Steren found a consistent crasher in the Python bindings).  These issues, among<br />
some others, are fixed by the wondrous liblicense 0.8.1.  I mentioned to Nathan Y. that liblicense is officially "no longer ghetto."</p>
<p>The best way enjoy liblicense is from our Ubuntu and Debian package repository, at <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/packages/">http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/packages/</a>.  More information on what liblicense does is <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/liblicense">available on our wiki page about liblicense</a>. You can also get them in fresh Fedora 11 packages.  And the source tarball is available for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80503&amp;package_id=238700&amp;release_id=649438">download from sourceforge.net</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. MERRY CHRISTMAS!</p>
<p>The full ChangeLog snippet goes like this:</p>
<p>liblicense 0.8.1 (2008-12-24):<br />
* Cleanups in the test suite: test_predicate_rw's path joiner finally works<br />
* Tarball now includes data_empty.png<br />
* Dynamic tests and static tests treat $HOME the same way<br />
* Fix a major issue with requesting localized informational strings, namely that the first match would be returned rather than all matches (e.g., only the first license of a number of matching licenses). This fixes the Python bindings, which use localized strings.<br />
* Add a cooked PDF example that actually works with exempi; explain why that is not a general solution (not all PDFs have XMP packets, and the XMP packet cannot be resized by libexempi)<br />
* Add a test for writing license information to the XMP in a PNG<br />
* Fix a typo in exempi.c<br />
* Add basic support for storing LL_CREATOR in exempi.c<br />
* In the case that the system locale is unset (therefore, is of value "C"), assume English<br />
* Fix a bug with the TagLib module: some lists were not NULL-terminated<br />
* Use calloc() instead of malloc()+memset() in read_license.c; this improves efficiency and closes a crasher on amd64<br />
* Improve chooser_test.c so that it is not strict as to the *order* the results come back so long as they are the right licenses.<br />
* To help diagnose possible xdg_mime errors, if we detect the hopeless application/octet-stream MIME type, fprintf a warning to stderr.<br />
* Test that searching for unknown file types returns a NULL result rather than a segfault.</p>
