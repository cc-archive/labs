<p>Yesterday we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/25965">launched a refresh of the site design</a> for <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">creativecommons.org</a>. Included in the changes pushed was one small one originally suggested by our international <a href="http://creativecommons.org/affiliates">Affiliate Network</a>: the inclusion of the license identifier on the deeds. </p>
<p><a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/files/2011/01/CC-BY-with-dc-identifier.png"><img src="img/CC-BY-with-dc-identifier.png" alt="" title="CC-BY with Short Name" width="794" height="442" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1370" /></a></p>
<p>Anyone who's been in the CC community for any length of time has seen people refer to the licenses by their short-hand names: CC BY for <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution</a>, BY-SA for <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a>, etc. But that short hand, while useful, has been a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_baseball_(metaphor)">inside baseball</a>: it's part of the URL, but never appeared on the deeds, which we want to be the human readable summary of the license. As of yesterday the short-hand name is now on the deed. We've also annotated it with RDFa, so the licenses self-describe their short name (software can dereference the license URI and look for information describing it there). Thanks again to Alek and the affiliate network for suggesting this change.</p>
