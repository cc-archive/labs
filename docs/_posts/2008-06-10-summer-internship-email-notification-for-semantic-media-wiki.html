<p>First I would like to introduce myself. I'm Steren Giannini, a French student from <a href="http://www.ec-lyon.fr/">Ecole Centrale de Lyon</a>, a college of general engeneering.Â  I'm working as a tech intern at Creative Commons SF. It's for me the first time I cross the Atlantic, so this stay in San Francisco is a real adventure. I'm very proud to do my part in the CC revolution.</p>
<p>During my school years, I created websites for companies (to make some spending money ;) ) and I recently worked on <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> : I've been enhancing the <a href="http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/ReleaseNotes047#Live_path_effects">Live Path Effect system</a>.</p>
<p>The first goal of my project at CC is to improve the internal task and project tracking system. It uses <a href="http://semantic-mediawiki.org/">Semantic MediaWiki</a>. Today tasks can be created and assigned to users. What I have to do is to add email notification to the system.</p>
<p>This means :</p>
<ul>
<li>send email to the assigned users when a task changes</li>
<li>send "reminder" emails to assigned users when due dates are approaching.</li>
</ul>
<p>So yesterday I started by reading some documentation about Semantic Web in general, RDF specification, MediaWiki and Semantic MediaWiki. Then I installed MediaWiki on my localhost in order to have a closer look to the code.</p>
<p>My first goal is to get used to the existing system before codding something.</p>
