<p>Earlier this week we updated the <a href="http://gitorious.org/discovered/repo">master branch</a> on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/DiscoverEd">DiscoverEd</a> <a href="http://gitorious.org/discovered">project</a>.  While this "release" contains many improvements, the biggest one by far is the use of named graphs for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Metadata_Provenance">tracking provenance</a>.  The initial DiscoverEd prototype supported multiple curators making statements about the same resource.  For example, the same photograph of the US moon landing might be useful for both a history and a physics course.  Unfortunately the initial prototype didn't retain information about who made each individual statement, which limited the ways in which you could refine your search.</p>
<p>With this week's release we're storing that information, and opening up more ways to explore the metadata stored about resources.  We use <a href="http://openjena.org">Jena</a> as our RDF store, and <a href="http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/ng4j/">Named Graphs for Jena</a> (NG4J) provide an elegant way to integrate this source information with DiscoverEd.</p>
<p>Also notable in this release is database independence.  Any <a href="http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/ng4j/#Persistence">database backend supported by NG4J</a> can be used with DiscoverEd, and the default configuration uses Derby for ease of experimentation and development.</p>
<p>Because we did not store metadata previously, we're recrawling our sources now.  Our instance of DiscoverEd will be updated with this code over the next week or two.</p>
