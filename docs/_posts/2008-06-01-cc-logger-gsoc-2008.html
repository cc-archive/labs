<p>Before I dive-in on what CC-Logger is all about, a small intro to who I am:</p>
<p>My name is <a href="http://ankitguglani.wordpress.com" title="Ankt Guglani">Ankit Guglani</a>, and I am an undergrad at Singapore Management University [<a href="http://sis.smu.edu.sg" title="SMU">link</a>]. I has been working on a research project called 'CC-Monitor' Since 2006 under the supervision of prof. Giorgos Cheliotis. This was my introduction to Creative Commons, I have been working on Collecting and Compiling CC-Metrics since.</p>
<p>This summer is again blessed with the <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html" title="Google Summer of Code - FAQ">Google, Summer of Code [GSoC]</a>. Yes, just like last year, Creative Commons [CC] is one of the mentoring organizations yet again. This time around there are 4 active CC-GSoC Projects; Here's what my GSoC project with CC [named CC-Logger] is all about.</p>
<p>The project aims to uncover the hidden metrics in the CC Logs. So I'll take look at the following logs (which are tucked away in an Amazon S3 account):</p>
<p>1) logs for creativecommons.org/license<br />
2) logs for i.creativecommons.org and creativecommons.org/images/licenses<br />
3) logs of creativecommons.org/licenses<br />
4) logs for search.creativecommons.org</p>
<p>Looking at these I hope to find additional information about CC usage such as switching patterns and click-through rates to the deeds, and then analyze and interpret these results. I also hope to come up with some indices / metrics that can be used as indicative predictors for trends.</p>
<p>I know, you're thinking it's summer of CODE, and this is all analysis, where is the code? Once I am done with coming up with metrics and indices, I get to code to automate the calculation (and possibly the web-publishing of the results) for all the future logs.</p>
<p>The fun part about this project is, the logs I need to analyze right now, are over 100 GB in size. I am so looking forward to having a local copy of that!</p>
<p>That's all for now, thanks to prof. Giorgos for getting me into CC, Mike for suggesting looking at the logs and of course Asheesh, for the mentoring. (-:</p>
