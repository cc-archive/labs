<p>For quite a few years CC has maintained an installation of <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">WordPress-mu</a>, which has hosted this blog, as well as blogs for a couple of CC jurisdictions.  Since CC's <a href="http://creativecommons.org">main site</a> is built on <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, this meant that with every new release of WordPress we would have to upgrade the main site, and also our WordPress-mu install.  Upgrading the main CC site was/is very easy, because it is managed with <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewsvn/ccwordpress/">version control</a>.</p>
<p>Well, with the release of WordPress 3.0, the functionality of WordPress-mu was integrated into the core WordPress code, so it's no longer necessary to maintain two separate code bases.  Upgrading Labs to WordPress 3.0 was (mostly) as easy as checking out <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewsvn/ccwordpress/branches/production/">the code</a> that runs creativecommons.org and dropping our WordPress-mu wp-config.php file into it, then running the update.php script.  We now maintain a single WordPress code base that runs both creativecommons.org, as well as our multi-site installation, which hosts this blog.</p>
