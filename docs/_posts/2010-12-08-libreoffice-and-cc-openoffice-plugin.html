<p>Over the summer, our GSOC student Akila Wajirasena gave a <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/08/20/creative-commons-openoffice-plug-in-version-0-7-0-released/">wonderful overhaul to our OpenOffice plugin</a> with many improvements, including a <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/07/03/creative-commons-open-office-plugin-gets-a-new-ui-and-supports-for-public-domain-tools/">slick new user interface, support for public domain tools,</a> and <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/05/20/creative-commons-open-office-plugin-here-it-is-with-some-new-features/">many other cool things</a>.  Recently he contacted us having looked into whether or not that plugin works with <a href="http://www.documentfoundation.org/download/">LibreOffice</a>, a fork of OpenOffice run by the Document Foundation, which has gathered significant interest from certain areas of the free and open source software world recently.</p>
<p>The good news?  It seems that it works just fine out of the box:</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/files/2010/12/cc_libreoffice_plugin_test.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1249" src="img/cc_libreoffice_plugin_test.png" alt="CC LibreOffice plugin test" width="712" height="572" /></a></p>
<p>We've only tested it on some limited systems though, so if you do have some problems, <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/issues/issue738">please report them here</a>.</p>
<p>We also included some instructions previously on how to fix an issue on GNU/Linux systems where the menu would become inaccessible, and you had to install via the command line to fix it.  That seems like it may be fixed in LibreOffice.</p>
<p>One concern though is that LibreOffice is trying to <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libreoffice/2010-November/001879.html">use less amounts of Java or completely abandon Java altogether</a>.  Probably Java extensions will be supported some way in the future regardless, but it may be something to keep our eye on.</p>
<p>Thanks to Akila again for his work not only on the plugin enhancements but also into looking into this with LibreOffice.</p>
