<p>Carolina Botero (of CC Colombia and now CC regional manager for Latin America) has posted a <a href="http://www.openbusinesslatinamerica.org/wp/2011/08/08/%C2%BFcomo-se-usan-las-licencias-creative-commons-en-latinoamerica/">brief analysis of CC license use in Latin America</a> (<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.openbusinesslatinamerica.org%2Fwp%2F2011%2F08%2F08%2F%25C2%25BFcomo-se-usan-las-licencias-creative-commons-en-latinoamerica%2F">es2en machine translation</a>).</p>
<p>As with <a href="http://web.si.umich.edu/tprc/papers/2007/805/CreateCommExp.pdf">previous</a> looks at CC licenses across different jurisdictions and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gcheliotis/assessing-cc-adoption-in-asia-manila">regions</a>, this one is based on search engine reported links to jurisdiction "ported" versions of licenses. It is great to see what researchers have done with this limited mechanism.</p>
<p>I am eager to explore other means of characterizing CC usage across regions and fields, and hope to provide more <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/12/09/available-for-analysis/">data</a> that will enable researchers to do this. This will be increasingly important as we attempt to forge a universal license that does not call for porting in the same way, with version 4.0 <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011">over</a> the coming year (as well as with the increasing <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28525">importance</a> of CC in the world).</p>
