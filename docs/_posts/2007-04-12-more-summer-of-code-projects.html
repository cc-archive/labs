<p>Nathan <a href="http://techblog.creativecommons.org/2007/04/12/summer-of-code-projects/">blogged the five accepted Creative Commons/Science Commons projects</a>.</p>
<p>There's also at least one CC-related SoC project being mentored by another oganization: <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/inkscape/appinfo.html?csaid=C7DF84C10F57F82D">ccHost/Inkscape integration</a> by Bruno LuÃ­s GonÃ§alves Dilly, mentored by Bryce Harrington for the Inkscape project. Bruno was a CC SoC student last year and Bryce just completed a contract project for CC...</p>
<p>It's also worth noting three of the proposals we would have loved to accept, if only Google had given us eight slots instead of five (no complaints!):</p>
<ul>
<li>An OpenOffice plugin for finding and importing CC licensed content (see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7204">ThinkFree's implementation</a>, contrast with the accepted OO.o project to CC license OO.o documents, similar to the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Microsoft_Office_Addin">MS Office Addin</a>).</li>
<li>A CC licensing module for Gallery2.</li>
<li>CC census, extending our adoption statistics project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many other projects are outlined on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer_Challenges">CC developer challenge pages</a>. Sorry only five could be accepted with Google financial support!</p>
