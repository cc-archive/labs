<p>Early this morning we launched some functionality on the main "license chooser":http://creativecommons.org/license previously available only on "Labs":http://labs.creativecommons.org.  As many (ok, at least a few) people have noted, we previously stopped embedding RDF in the HTML generated by the chooser.  As we've "noted":http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Extend_Metadata#Embedding_RDF_in_HTML in the past, RDF in a comment has several draw backs, not the least of which is that it's opaque to parsers.  The new update to the license chooser restores the embedded metadata using "RDFa":http://rdfa.info.</p>
<p>As the name implies, RDFa is a way of expressing RDF using _attributes_ in the HTML.  This is similar to microformats, but different in that any RDFa parser can read any RDFa information -- no special knowledge required.  So the new metadata once again allows you to encode the name of your work, your name, and the type of work, all in the HTML.  A full example (with all fields filled in) is shown here:</p>
<div align="center">
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"><br />
<img alt="Creative Commons License" src="img/88x31.png" /><br />
</a><br />

<p>So how do you know the metadata is there?  Check out the "RDFa Bookmarklets":http://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/RDFa/impl/js/ which demonstrate how you can expose the information using some simple Javascript.</p>
<p>*UPDATE* Unfortunately WordPress MU strips out attributes it doesn't recognize, so the example above isn't as complete as it could be.</p>
