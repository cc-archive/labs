<p>Never trust a programmer when he gives you a date for <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2008/06/13/flickr-image-re-use-for-openofficeorg-updates/" target="_blank">something to be done</a> . Thats what i did in my last article (2 weeks i think i said then) and here we are a month later.</p>
<p>What has be done since my last article :</p>
<ul>
<li>right click on an result (image) will show you a popup menu with the available sizes on Flickr server</li>
<li>left click on a result will insert directly in Writer the image with size medium as default</li>
<li>once the image is inserted some text will be added beside the image(title , link to the image, license and link to the license)</li>
<li>i improved searching and the way the image is adding into Writer</li>
<li>i added a more friendly interface when you want to search over license (similar with advanced search on Flickr website)</li>
<li>added a previous button to see previous results if needed</li>
<li>if you insert a image, when you open again the extension the previous search will be done immediately (  on the exact the same position if you used the previous or next buttons)</li>
<li>about searching : we can have multiple tags (separated by space : " ") and the relation between them is AND . also the results are ordered by interestingness</li>
<li>a progress bar was added</li>
<li>the extension after installation can be found here : Insert  Picture  From Flickr ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Some screenshots :</p>

<p><a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/files/2008/07/popupmenu.jpg" target="_blank">Right click on an image</a></p>
<p><a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/files/2008/07/insertedimageinwriter.jpg" target="_blank">Inserted image into Writer</a></p>
<p>Also i would to add that this extension, at this momment, works only in Writer.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewsvn/ccooo/branches/mihai-flickr-soc/demo13072008/ccooo.oxt?revision=10484" target="_self">Download</a> (right click and save as)</p>
<p>Any suggestions or remarks are greatly appreciated.</p>
