<p>I was recently tasked with encoding all of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos">CC's videos</a> into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebM">WebM</a>, a new open video container format.</p>
<p>I started out by <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/WebM">creating a table</a> of all of the videos and target quality. Then, I started to track down the highest quality version of each video I could find.</p>
<p>At first I had high hopes of using ffmpeg (with libvpx support) wrapped in a bash script to batch process all of the videos into .webm. Although there are some <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=786095">decent directions</a> to re-compiling ffmpeg to enable webm, I ran into trouble (some sort of version conflict) and wasn't able to complete the process.</p>
<p>So after searching around, I found a few promising leads on the <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/tools/">WebM tools page</a>.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="http://www.getmiro.com/">Miro</a> have come out with <a href="http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/">Miro Video Converter</a>, which is a useful-looking tool that promises a simple way to encode video for mobile devices and the web. It purports to support webm, but sadly I wasn't able to test it as they don't currently develop a version for Linux (only Windows and OSX).</p>
<p>Next I tried installed the <a href="http://firefogg.org/make/">Fireogg</a> extension into Firefox and tested the process by converting one small .mov file into .webm. I was surprised how well it worked, although as far as I could tell it lacked a method to batch-process or queue files (or at least that functionality isn't within scope for its purpose). It also took an unreasonably long time to transcode the video, so my search continued.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://www.transcoder.org/">Arista Transcoder</a>, I found a Linux application that seemed to work. In Ubuntu, setup was as simple as extracting the archive and running <tt>python setup.py install --install-layout=deb</tt> (provided you have python installed). The <a href="http://www.transcoder.org/presets/">Web Browser (Advanced)</a> preset gave me the ability to queue up and transcode the videos into 360p, 480p, and 720p .webm with reasonable transcoding times.</p>
<p>One minor hurdle was to encode the videos into 240p WebM, a resolution not included in the Web Browser (Advanced) preset package. To accomplish that, I modified the json preset file to include 240p into webm. You can download my modified version of the json file in the preset <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/~akozak/web-advanced.json">here</a>. My only modification comes at the end. You should be able to just copy my version into <tt>~/.arista/presets</tt> and replace the original if it exists.</p>
<p>When we start to embed the files on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos">creativecommons.org/videos</a>, I plan on following the instructions in the <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html">Dive Into HTML5 Video chapter</a>.</p>
