<p>Some of these could turn out to be interesting for describing licensed content on the web, all rather interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/audio-info-proposal">hAudio</a> proposed microformat.</p>
<p>Proposed <a href="http://wiki.digitalbazaar.com/en/HAudio_RDFa">hAudio to RDFa mapping</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://sw.joanneum.at/rammx/">RDFa-deployed Multimedia Medata</a> (ramm.x) may be an effort to map and standardize use of existing and upcoming media description standards in RDFa ... I had to skim "ramm.x in 10 sec" and "what ramm.x is NOT" a few times to gather that, but the key description on that page seems to be:</p>
<blockquote><dl>
<dt>Does ramm.x replace RDF-based multimedia vocabularies, as, e.g., the <a href="http://musicontology.com/">Music Ontology Specification</a>?</dt>
<dd> 	No! ramm.x aims at bringing existing formats, as MPEG-7 and the like, into the Semantic Web. It acts as a bridge using a  	<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/mmsem/XGR-vocabularies/#formal">certain formalisation</a>	of an existing vocabulary.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting a bit more esoteric, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/powder-grouping/">Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER)</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>facilitates the publication of descriptions of multiple resources such as all those available from a Web site.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is a bit of an understatement.</p>
