<p>We just pushed a new feature set to CC Network; most of these are OpenID related, and I'll try to write more in depth about the interesting ones in the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now elect to "always trust" an OpenID site</li>
<li>Commoner (the code behind the CC Network) now supports the Simple Registration extension to OpenID</li>
<li>We have preliminary (experimental) support for Verisign's <a href="https://pip.verisignlabs.com/seatbelt.do">OpenID Seatbelt</a> extension</li>
<li>We've added a link that to "add another" after you register a work</li>
<li>You can now select a full size or "thin" network badge (similar to the license badges)</li>
<li>We've added a link in the <code>head</code> of profile and work list pages that points to the RDF/XML file; we still consider RDFa the primary vehicle but this may help others ingest the data</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things you think we should add?  Let us know -- <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/issues">create an issue</a> or email <a href="mailto:issues@creativecommons.org">issues@creativecommons.org</a>.</p>
