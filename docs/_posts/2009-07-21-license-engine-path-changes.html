<p>We just pushed out a resolution to <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/issues/issue381">Issue 381</a>, updating the path to the license engine.  The license engine (the <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewsvn/cc.engine/">cc.engine</a> application) is responsible for handling the license selection portions of the website as well as the deeds.  Some background may be helpful.</p>
<p>When we launched CC0 earlier this year we made a conscious decision to locate the deed on a different path than the rest of the license deeds.  CC0 is a <em>waiver</em>, not a <em>license</em>, so the deed appropriately is located at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</a> (as opposed to the license deeds which URLs that look like <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>).  At the time we decided to leave the CC0 chooser in the same group as the other choosers.  This unfortunately gave us a URL that contained <code>license</code> in it -- <code>http://creativecommons.org/license/zero/</code> -- which caused confusion for some users.  Is it a license or isn't it?</p>
<p>It's not.  </p>
<p>So starting this afternoon we've relocated the license engine to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose">http://creativecommons.org/choose</a> and CC0 to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero">http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero</a>.  Redirects are in place so you shouldn't notice any changes.</p>
