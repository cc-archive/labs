<p>For a couple years CC has been using the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pywikipediabot">Pywikipediabot</a> to do a few small operations on a password-protected, private installation of <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">Mediawiki</a>.  It used to create a basic page, then ask people to add information to that page, and then a few days later it would email the contents of that page to a group of people.</p>
<p>As of a today we are no longer using Pywikipediabot to create a page, but only to mail the contents of a page.  It occurred to me that Pywikipediabot was really overkill for such a small task.  I decided to write a simple shell script using wget to accomplish this task.  My initial thought was to use the <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page">Mediawiki API</a>, but all the documents I found indicated that if one merely wanted the content of a page, to use the <em>action</em> query parameter to index.php, such as <em>/SomeArticle?action=raw</em>.  It wasn't even clear to me that there would be a way to accomplish what I wanted via the API without having to parse an XML response (there may be, I just didn't readily find it).</p>
<p>So I decided to use wget to work with the normal user interface of Mediawiki, but I didn't quickly find any good information on how to go about this, or what I found was outdated and no longer worked.  I'm posting this here in case it could be useful to anyone else.  Here is the basic idea:</p>
<pre style="border: thin dashed blue; padding: 1em;">
#!/bin/bash

PAGE_TITLE="Some_page_title"

RCPT_TO=group@somesite.com
MAIL_FROM="'John Q. Public' &lt;management@somesite.com&gt;"
MAIL_SUBJECT="Contents of ${PAGE_TITLE}"

MW_LOGIN="Some Login"
MW_PASSWD="somepassword"

# Mediawiki uses a login token, and we must have it for this to work.
WP_LOGIN_TOKEN=$(wget -q -O - --save-cookies cookies.txt --keep-session-cookies 
                                     http://www.somesite.com/Special:UserLogin 
                                     | grep wpLoginToken | grep -o '[a-z0-9]{32}')

wget -q --load-cookies cookies.txt --save-cookies cookies.txt --keep-session-cookies 
        --post-data "wpName=${MW_LOGIN}&wpPassword=${MW_PASSWD}
&wpRemember=1&wpLoginattempt=Log%20in&wpLoginToken=${WP_LOGIN_TOKEN}" 
        "http://www.somesite.com/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&action=submitlogin&type=login"

wget -q -O email_body.txt --load-cookies cookies.txt 
        "http://www.somesite.com/${PAGE_TITLE}?action=raw"

cat email_body.txt | mail -s "${MAIL_SUBJECT}" -a "From: ${MAIL_FROM}" ${RCPT_TO}
</pre>
