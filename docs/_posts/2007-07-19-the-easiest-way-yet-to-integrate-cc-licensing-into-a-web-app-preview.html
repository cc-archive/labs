<p>I've been working for the past week or so on a JavaScript licensing widget that has been <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/JsWidget">suggested on our wiki</a>.  It's a new way to integrate CC licensing into your web application.  It's really as easy as pie: Just add the following tag somewhere in the body:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;script src="http://api.creativecommons.org/jswidget/tags/0.1/complete.js" /&gt;</p></blockquote>
<p>and a CC licensing widget will appear.  Your web application can then use<br />
regular DOM queries to determine the user's choice.</p>
<p>NOTE that this is not ready for prime-time use!  I want feedback on what people would like us to add or change.  Right now it serves only English-language text; in the future you will be able to add ?locale=, stick your language code at the end, and get text back in your language.  Beyond translation, tell me how else I can be of service!</p>
<p>You can download a trivial sample application and a long-ish README at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80503&amp;package_id=239510">our SourceForge project</a>.  For y'all's convenience here's a <a href="https://cctools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cctools/jswidget/tags/0.1/example_web_app/README">link to the README</a>.</p>
<p>It'll take you all of five minutes to deeply understand what's going on, so I suggest you do if you're thinking about (or if you already are) offering CC licensing to users of web applications you work on.</p>
<p>(P.S. This is <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-devel/2007-July/000526.html">cross-posted to the cc-devel list</a>.)</p>
