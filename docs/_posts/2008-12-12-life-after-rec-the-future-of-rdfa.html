<p>Ben Adida is back again from the first tech conference with a new talk about RDFa.</p>
<p>First he gave a brief review of RDFa: there exists a huge chasm between the human web and the data web. RDFa addresses our need to bridge this gap. We want machine-readable metadata so we can use computer programs to answer simple questions about a work to save on time and effort. He then moved on to explaining ccREL, the Creative Commons Rights Expression Language. There are four principles for publishing in HTML: 1) visual correspondence, 2) don't repeat yourself, 3) remix friendliness, 4) extensibility and modularity.</p>
<p>For the main portion of his talk, Ben went over the events of the past six months regarding RDFa adoption.</p>
<ul>
<li>April-May: Digg deployed RDFa.</li>
<li>June: RDFa goes W3C "Candidate Recommendation" with around 12 implementations (parsers).</li>
<li>June: Open Archives Initiatives supports RDFa; UK National Archive uses RDFa.</li>
<li>September: Yahoo SearchMonkey deploys RDFa support.</li>
<li>October: RDFa goes W3C Recommendation.</li>
<li>November: CC launches the CC network in November; Drupal announces roadmap for RDFa integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>He concluded with a demonstration of sample <a title="Search Monkey" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/searchmonkey/" target="_blank">SearchMonkey</a> functionality that grabs CC license metadata from search results and displays that information on the search page.</p>
<p>What's next?, asks Ben, with a strong disclaimer that this is just a small glimpse of what is possible. He points to HTML 4 and 5 integration, the simplification of common cases (not having to keep redefining common namespaces), finding common ground with the microformat community, and better search and in-browser tools.</p>
<p>The question Ben asks you to take away is this: What are you waiting for to consume and/or publish RDFa?</p>
