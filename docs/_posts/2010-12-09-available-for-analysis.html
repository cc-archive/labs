<p>Recently asked about CC use for works in Arabic. There are no Arabic-language jurisdiction ports available at this time; measuring adoption of jurisdiction ports is the easiest way to characterize patterns of adoption, as has been done by Giorgos Cheliotis, with <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7701">interesting results</a> -- also see <a href="http://monitor.creativecommons.org">http://monitor.creativecommons.org</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately there is some other data available that could be used to characterize CC use, irrespective of porting, across some languages and countries. This data is described at <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Metrics/Data_Catalog#License_property_search_engine_API_queries" target="_blank">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Metrics/Data_Catalog#License_property_search_engine_API_queries</a> and available from <a href="../metrics/sql-dumps/all.sql.gz" target="_blank">http://labs.creativecommons.org/metrics/sql-dumps/all.sql.gz</a><br />
(warning, approximately 200 megabytes).</p>
<p>Nobody has analyzed this part of the available data on CC adoption yet to my knowledge. Anyone is of course welcome and encouraged to!</p>
