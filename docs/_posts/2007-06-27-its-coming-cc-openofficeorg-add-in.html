<p>As you may know, I am working on this project as part of the Google Summer of Code program. Before starting, Fran√ßois Dechelle was already engaged and now we are joining efforts to develop this potentially-popular application!</p>
<p>The current state of the prototype is already adding the licenses in the body of the document. </p>
<p><img src="img/screen1m.jpg" alt="The license wizard" /></p>
<p>After the license have been chosen, it becomes available as an Auto-Text, being able to be easily replicable in the document without having to create a new wizard. The name of the license and the URL are also being stored in the document' metadata.</p>
<p><img src="img/screen2m.jpg" alt="License text inserted" /></p>
<p>Currently I am working on a weird bug which is not allowing the ooo API to retrieve some images of the available licenses at http://i.creativecommons.org/l/ (it was working perfectly few days ago...)</p>
<p>We're going to commit a stable version ready for download in the next weeks, but if you are eager to use it you can check out this folder at cctools repository:</p>
<p><a href="http://cctools.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cctools/ccooo/">./ccooo/</a></p>
<p>Feedbacks and suggestions are welcome!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
