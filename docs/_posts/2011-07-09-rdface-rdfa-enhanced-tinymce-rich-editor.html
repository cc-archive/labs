<p>For a long time -- it feels like much longer than the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/RDFa_Plugin_for_WordPress">RDFa Plugin for WordPress tech challenge</a> has been on the wiki (28 months) -- the idea that there should be such a thing has been around. I recall multiple Summer of Code applications proposing to tackle the problem. However, it is a really hard UI problem.</p>
<p>I'm really happy to see the <a href="http://blog.aksw.org/2011/rdface-put-an-smile-on-the-face-of-semantic-content-authoring/">announcement</a> of <a href="http://aksw.org/Projects/RDFaCE">RDFaCE</a>, which does most of the hard work.</p>
<p>Without reading any documentation or watching their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uVGbZIWYto">screencast</a> (still haven't watched it, no idea if it is any good!) I was able to add a cc:attributionName annotation specific to the image in their <a href="http://rdface.aksw.org/test/tinymce/examples/rdfaDemo.html">demo</a> on my first try:</p>
<ul>
<li>select the photographer name, insert cc:attributionName annotation with literal value already in the text. RDFaCE seems to already know the correct cc: namespace mapping.</li>
<li>select content around photo, set subject to photo URL</li>
<li>verify that triples produced are correct</li>
</ul>
<p>Granted I more or less know what I'm doing. But, so do lots of other people. Contrary to some impressions, annotating stuff on the web with name-value pairs ("stuff" is the subject in the "triple") is hardly brain-twisting.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing RDFaCE bundled in a WordPress plugin with some awareness of the WordPress media manager, and using on this very blog.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyMCE">TinyMCE</a> is the free software rich text editor used in lots of projects in addition to WordPress, so this is a great step forward!</p>
