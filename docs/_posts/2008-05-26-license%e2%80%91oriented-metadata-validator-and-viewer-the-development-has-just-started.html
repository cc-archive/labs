<p>Creative Commons <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/cc/about.html">participates</a> in <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Google Summer of Code™</a> and has accepted a proposal (see the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/cc/appinfo.html?csaid=3C284456287C63B9">abstract</a>) of <a href="http://hugo.dworak.info/">Hugo Dworak</a> based on its description of a task to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Rewrite_Metadata_Validator" title="Rewrite Metadata Validator">rewrite</a> its now-defunct <a href="http://validator.creativecommons.org/" title="http://validator.creativecommons.org" rel="nofollow">metadata validator</a>. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#83">Asheesh Laroia</a> has been assigned as the mentor of the project. The work began on May 26th, 2008 as per the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_timeline">project timeline</a>. It is expected to be completed in twelve weeks. More details will be provided in the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Rewrite_Metadata_Validator/SoC_2008">dedicated CC Wiki article</a> and the progress will be weekly featured on this blog.</p>
<p>The project focuses on developing an on-line tool — free software written in Python — to validate digitally embedded Creative Commons licenses within files of different types. Files will be pasted directly to a form, identified by a <abbr title="Universal Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, or uploaded by a user. The application will present the results in a human?readable fashion and notify the user if the means used to express the license terms are deprecated.</p>
