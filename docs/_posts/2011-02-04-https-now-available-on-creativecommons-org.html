<p>A week or two ago we received a request from someone to add HTTPS support to creativecommons.org.  A reasonable request at all events, but the specific impetus for the email was someone who develops an application that uses CC's <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Partner_Interface">Partner Interface</a> to integrate CC licensing.  Their interface is SSL-enabled, and so accessing the Partner Interface over a normal, non-encrypted channel was giving his users browser warnings about accessing non-encrypted data.  I'm happy to announce that creativecommons.org is now available <a href="https://creativecommons.org">over an encrypted connection</a>.  Thanks to Peter Dietz for prodding us to implement this. </p>
