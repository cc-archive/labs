<p>As title might suggest, i have been selected for <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">GSoC 2008</a>. As mentor for this  <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Flickr_Image_Re-Use_for_OpenOffice.org">project</a> has been assigned <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#31">Nathan Yergler</a>.</p>
<p>The developing will focus on 3 key functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li> ability to search photos by tags</li>
<li> filter search results by license attributes</li>
<li> insert the image into the document along with attribution information</li>
</ul>
<p>The first 2 steps were done(of course, this will not be the final version) in small <a href="http://students.info.uaic.ro/~mhusleag/FlickrOOPlugin.oxt">demo </a>that i attached to my application for <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">GSoC 2008</a>.  The <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice </a>components for which the extension will be implemented are Writer, Impress and Calc.</p>
<p>The application will be written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_language">Java</a>, using <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> with its plugin <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/community/magazine/html/03/openoffice/">OpenOffice NetBeans Integration</a>.</p>
<p>A short introduction : I`m Mihai Husleag, 24 years old, student in <a href="http://www.infoiasi.ro/bin/Main/?language=en">Computer Science</a>, at <a href="http://www.uaic.ro/uaic/bin/view/Main/?language=en">Alexandru Ioan Cuza University</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iasi">Iasi</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania">Romania</a>. My previous experience as programmer is more related to the  .NET framework.  Another thing about me, if in the weekends i`m not reachable then its a high probability that you will find me <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/muntomanul1/PiatraCraiului/photo#5144739821863831250">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions about this project(new functionalities, things you don't like, etc)  feel free to leave a comment.</p>
