<p>We've been working over the past year on improving our tooling and processes for the CC website software, and we're starting to see the results.  We've moved our translations to <a href="http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/CC/">Transifex</a>, where updates are committed directly to <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewgit/i18n.git/">our git repository</a>.  We've rolled out a new version of the <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewgit/cc.engine.git">license engine</a> with different (better!) <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/wsigcache">caching</a>.  And our <a href="http://api.creativecommons.org/">API</a> now uses the same <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewgit/license.rdf.git/">license definition</a> as the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose">license chooser</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Partner_Interface">partner interface</a>.  While this has been great in terms of agility and deployment speed, it also means that if a single piece breaks, other things are more likely to depend on that piece.  </p>
<p>Earlier this week I spent a little time installing <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/">Hudson</a> on our <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org">development server</a>.  By looking at the <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/hudson">dashboard</a>, you can easily see the build status of CC projects, including the aforementioned license components, and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/DiscoverEd">DiscoverEd</a>, our linked data search prototype.  </p>

<p>Hudson is already proving itself worth the time to deploy and configure.  After installation, I saw that a test for the API was failing.  I pinged John, and was happy to see the build go green a few minutes later when he checked in a fix and Hudson rebuilt the package.  Graphs like the testing trend for <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/hudson/job/discovered/">discovered</a> also help quantify the progress being made. Overall, it already feels like we have better visibility into the state of our infrastructure. </p>
