<p>You may have noticed that the copy-and-paste HTML you get from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">CC license chooser</a> includes some strange attributes you're probably not familiar with. That is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a> metadata, and it allows for the CC license deeds, search engines, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/Attribution_generator">Open Attribute</a>, and other tools to discover metadata about your work and generate attribution HTML. Many platforms have implemented CC REL metadata in their CC license marks, such as <a href="http://cnx.org/">Connexions</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, and it's our recommended way to mark works with a CC license.</p>
<p>In an effort to make CC license metadata (or <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_REL">CC REL metadata</a>) much easier to implement, we've created <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2011/ccrel-guide">CC REL by Example</a>. It includes many example HTML pages, as well as explanations and links to more information.</p>
<p>We're hoping this guide will serve as a useful set of examples for developers and publishers who want to publish metadata for CC licensed works. Even if you just use CC licenses for your own content, now is a great time to take a first step into structured data and include information about how you'd <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2011/ccrel-guide/#Attribution">like to be attributed</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewgit/ccrel-guide.git/">source to the guide</a> in git. Feedback and suggestions can be sent to <a href="mailto:webmaster@creativecommons.org">webmaster@creativecommons.org</a>.</p>
