<blockquote><em>Stay up to date and don't miss your deadline any more with the brand new email task notifications and reminders.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I created this as an extension of <em><a id="okoq1" class="external text" title="http://semantic-mediawiki.org" rel="nofollow" href="http://semantic-mediawiki.org/">SemanticÂ MediaWiki</a>. </em>It is mainly supposed to be used as an internal tool at CC. Basicaly, it sends email to concerned users each time a tasks is created or updated. It also sends reminders at different date before your deadline.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on an online release of the entire <em>project and task tracking system</em> used here, so stay tuned.</p>
