<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I'm Jason Kivlighn, a selected student for Google's Summer of Code.  Here's the gist of my project:</p>
<blockquote><p>Working under Creative Commons, I will extended the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/tracker/">Tracker</a> search and indexing engine to support the extraction of license claims. Because of the various forms that the license may take, I will build support based on the recommendations of Creative Commons, as outlined at http://creativecommons.org/technology/usingmarkup...<br />
At the very least, the project will result in Tracker gaining support for indexing license claims embedding in MP3, OGG, PDF, HTML, and XML formats.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now for a little about myself.  I'm an undergraduate at the University of Washington in Seattle majoring in Computer Engineering.  I've been an Open Source enthusiast since I found Linux as a development platform about 6 years ago.  I developed <a href="http://krecipes.sf.net">Krecipes</a> for a few years and now am working on <a href="http://mdn.wikidot.com">Sidestream</a>, a network for artists to distribute their works.  I like hacking together projects here and there as I see fit.  My <a href="http://students.washington.edu/jkivligh/uwroutes/">UW campus shortest route finder</a> was a fun little project to settle the "What's the fastest way from X to Y" disputes once-and-for-all.</p>
<p>My spring quarter is a hassle of Comp. Eng. studies and TA'ing for the 'Programming Languages' course; but as summer rolls around, I'll be ready for a summer of hacking with Tracker and CC :-)</p>
