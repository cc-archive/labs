<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I also was selected for the Google Summer of Code with this project mentored by Nathan R. Yergler. An introduction about the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The goal of this project is to provide a tool for supporting the process of licensing documents. <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Microsoft_Office_Addin">Microsoft Office has a Creative Commons plug-in</a> to put licenses metadata in its documents. I propose a similar <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OpenOfficeOrg_Addin">Creative Commons add-in for OpenOffice.org</a> that would allow license information to be embedded in OpenOffice.org documents. Despite being a requested feature for OpenOffice.org for more than two years, nothing has materialized. Having a simple way to add Creative Commons licenses will help to spread those licenses much more broadly. Making licenses available as Autotext for example, is one way this can be reached.</p></blockquote>
<p>At first moment, I will concentrate on OOo Writer plugin, but of course, I have plans to extend this functionality to Calc and Impress as well. Get the full proposal <a href="http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~cam2/soc2007proposal.txt">here</a>. If you have any suggestion, please let me know.</p>
<p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Cassio Melo, I'm 22 old and I live in Recife, Brazil. I'm an undergraduate at the same university of Alan Kelon (<a href="http://www.cin.ufpe.br">Informatics Center</a>, <a href="http://www.ufpe.br">Federal University of Pernambuco</a>). </p>
<p>Beyond my passion for Computer Science, I also have interests in Business and Economy. <a href="http://www.e-drexler.com/p/idx04/00/0404drexlerBioCV.html">Eric Drexler</a> and <a href="http://www.claytonchristensen.com/">Clayton Christensen</a> are my preferred authors.</p>
<p>I did work for a summer in my undergraduate course at Federal University of Pernambuco with the <a href="https://simple.dev.java.net/">SimPLe</a>, which is an open source software factory using Product Line approach for action games domain.</p>
<p>This year, I developed an OOo plugin to replace the existing OOo notes. Public distribution will begin in the near future.</p>
<p>Additionally I have a year of industrial experience, having worked as a software engineer on <a href="http://www.cesar.org.br">C.E.S.A.R</a>,  developing a <a href="http://wdbc2006.cesar.org.br/wp-content/uploads/23959.pdf">tool</a> (codenamed BART project) for software components search and retrieval. We also have developed plugins for Eclipse, MS Word and OpenOffice.org for supporting artifacts searching. As a member of the <a href="http://www.rise.com.br">R.i.S.E</a> group, I've worked on algorithms for ranking software components.</p>
<p>You can view my full profile <a href="http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~cam2/info/english">here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to share the thanks with my friends. We hope to bring new energy and enthusiasm to CC projects. :)</p>
