<p>
This week most of the work on the <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/05/24/gsoc-project-introduction-cc-wordpress-plugin/">plugin</a> consisted of styling changes and fixing bugs, mainly regressions that sneaked in due to the rewrite of functions that are now using the API. Still, there are some new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The <i>embed</i> button</b>: Suggested by <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Beckedahl">Markus Beckedahl</a>, a re-embedding possibility actively promotes sharing content. Clicking on the button reveals a text input filled with the markup necessary to put a copy of the media item into another website. Bonus: The re-embedded content keeps the style of the original content and <em>also</em> sports an embed-button.</li>
<li><b>An API cache</b>: Results of queries to the <a href="http://api.creativecommons.org/docs/">CC REST API</a> are now saved for two weeks, using the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API">Wordpress Transients API</a>. This speeds up figure generation and the administration page tremendously.</li>
<li><b>Automagic locale selection</b>: The plugin now simply uses the Wordpress locale.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I also made a <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/movingimages/wordpress-cc-plugin.ogv">screencast</a>, approximately 6 minutes long, that demonstrates how the plugin is used.</p>
<p>
For the remaining few days, I have three things to resolve: First, there is a bug preventing the embed markup to show up properly in Internet Explorer 6 and 7. Second, provided that I find the corresponding hook, I will add license icons to the media manager overview. Third, a proper README file needs to be written.</p>
