<p>Today I released <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/WpLicense">wpLicense</a> 0.7.6 (<strike>download</strike> see update below).  It's a minor bug fix, but one worth noting.  Thanks to Tiago and CristÃ³bal for both reporting the bug.</p>
<p>The bug was simple: the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/WpLicense_Function_Reference">documentation</a> says that the <code>licenseUri</code> function returns the URI of the selected license.  And that's what the internal wpLicense code relied on.  However, the implementation actually <code>echo</code>'d the URI, introducing a race condition: if things were timed <em>just right</em>, the problem wasn't apparent.  But too often they weren't, and then it was.</p>
<p>There are some outstanding issues with wpLicense, particularly with rendering the selection interface under Internet Explorer.  That's just one of the tasks new <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities#web">web engineer</a> will be tackling when he or she comes on board.  Which reminds me, we're still accepting resumes.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" /><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Yeah, so 0.7.6 only had half the fix; well, the entire fix, but I was braindead with the default parameter value.  So I give you <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/wplicense/download/wplicense-0.7.6.1.zip">0.7.6.1</a>.</p>
