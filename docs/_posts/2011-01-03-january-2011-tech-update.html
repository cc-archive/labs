<p>Highlights from December, 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li>We <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/25829">concluded our annual campaign</a>. Thanks to everyone who helped us raise over $500,000; your support is greatly appreciated. (And it's not too late to <a href="http://creativecommons.net/donate">contribute</a>!)</li>
<li>We verified that our OpenOffice.org plugin is <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/12/08/libreoffice-and-cc-openoffice-plugin/">compatible with LibreOffice</a>, so obviously it needs a better name than CCOOo. Suggestions? Leave a comment.</li>
<li>John Bishop shipped <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/12/06/xmp-fileinfo-panel-for-adobe-creative-suites-4-and-5-now-available/">updated CC + XMP support</a> for Adobe CS 4 and CS 5</li>
<li>We began transcoding our <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/12/03/webm-encoding-ccs-videos/">videos into WebM</a>, a free codec for HTML5 video</li>
<li>Metadata <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/12/10/towards-expressive-and-interoperable-common-core-metadata/">interoperability</a> and <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/12/15/thesis-on-metadata-interoperability-rdf/">harmonization</a> continues to be an area we're paying attention to, particularly with respect to OER, where there's no clear winner [yet].</li>
<li>And while technically from November, it bears highlighting that <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/11/18/technical-case-studies-now-on-the-wiki/">Technical Case Studies</a> are now in the CC wiki.</li>
</ul>
