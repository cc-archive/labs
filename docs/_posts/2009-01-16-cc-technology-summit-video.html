<p>In December we held our second <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-12-12">CC Technology Summit at MIT</a> in Cambridge, MA.  I think the day provided a great perspective on what we're doing at CC and how others are building a real community around it.  If you weren't able to attend, we now have <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/cc-techsummit-200812-audio">audio</a> and <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/videos/tech-summit-dec-2008">video</a> available.  And if you missed <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-06-18">the first one</a>, the <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/videos/cc-technology-summit-june-2008/">video</a> for that is available as well.</p>
<p>We're currently thinking about plans for the next event; if you have feedback or suggestions, email them to <a href="mailto:techsummit@creativecommons.org">techsummit@creativecommons.org</a>.</p>
