<p><a href="http://kmr.nada.kth.se/papers/SemanticWeb/FromInteropToHarm-MikaelsThesis.pdf">From Interoperability to Harmonization in Metadata Standardization - Designing an Evolvable Framework for Metadata Harmonization</a> (pdf) by Mikael Nilsson:</p>
<blockquote><p>The analytical  framework is used to analyze and compare seven metadata specifications, and a<br />
concrete set of harmonization issues is presented. These issues are used as a basis for a metadata<br />
harmonization framework where a multitude of metadata specifications with different character-<br />
istics can coexist. <strong>The thesis concludes that the Resource Description Framework (RDF) is the<br />
only existing specification that has the right characteristics to serve as a practical basis for such a<br />
harmonization  framework,  and therefore must be taken into account when designing metadata<br />
specifications.</strong> Based on the harmonization framework, a best practice for metadata standardiza-<br />
tion development is developed, and a roadmap for harmonization improvements of the analyzed<br />
standards is presented.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nilsson will defend his thesis on 2010-12-15, and you can watch (<a href="https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=DC-GENERAL;ed4e0c0.1012">details</a>).</p>
<p>Thinking in RDF is the natural thing to do at Creative Commons, whether modeling <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_REL">license attributes</a>, work <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/~nathan/oscri/describing-registrations.html">registration</a>, or domain-specific <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/12/03/type-of-educational-an-idea/">descriptions</a> that add value to licensed works. Nice to see in depth academic backing for this intuition.</p>
