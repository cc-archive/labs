<p>Hello, my name's Igor Lukanin. I'm a 21 year old student of the <a href="http://ustu.ru/">Ural Federal University</a> located in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Russian+Federation,+Sverdlovskaya+oblast,+Yekaterinburg&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=33.710275,53.789062&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Yekaterinburg,+gorodskoy+okrug+gorod+Ekaterinburg,+Province+of+Sverdlovsk,+Russian+Federation&amp;ll=43.834527,139.21875&amp;spn=129.775476,346.289063&amp;z=2">Yekaterinburg</a>, Russia. Despite the fact that I study IT security, I've always been interested in the <abbr title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> initiative and licensing issues, that's why I'm proud to present the other <abbr title="Google Summer of Code">GSoC</abbr> project here at <abbr title="Creative Commons">CC</abbr>. But first, I should thank <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#nathanyergler">Nathan Yergler</a> who was giving valuable comments on the project proposal, and my mentor <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#johndoig">John Doig</a> who is always willing to help, letting me work around any obstacles I face.</p>
<h3>Project Introduction</h3>
<p>The project is intended to develop an extension for Mozilla Firefox web browser that would make it easy to find <abbr title="Creative Commons">CC</abbr>-licensed content on browsed pages, know the license and its terms, clarify their meaning and generate correct attribution information for content re-usage. The major advantage of this project is its (future) nice and polished <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> (a <a href="http://simplest-image-hosting.net/i0-info-png-0.png">mockup</a> of the browser's Page Info dialog is available).<br />

Paying attention to the seamy side of life, I should mention that the extension would do its magic by parsing RDFa metadata. It seems that it would perfectly consume the outcome of the <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/05/24/gsoc-project-introduction-cc-wordpress-plugin/"><abbr title="Google Summer of Code">GSoC</abbr> Wordpress plugin</a>, as well as work with a huge number of existing web-sites providing RDFa metadata.</p>
<p>A bit more information may be found in the <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewgit/cc.ff_ext.git/plain/doc/proposal.pdf">project proposal</a> (choose Save Link As from the context menu).</p>
<h3>Weekly Reports #1-2</h3>
<p>The strong side of my project is that the result of the development may be easily observed. The <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewgit/cc.ff_ext.git/plain/cc.ff_ext.xpi">current version</a> of the extension (as well, choose Save Link As from the context menu, then install) is capable of parsing RDFa metadata and showing gathered triples in a separate tab of the browser's Page Info dialog (an icon in the location bar may be clicked to get there).</p>
<p>I spent the 1st week creating the skeleton code of my extension and observing available solutions that may be used to parse RDFa data in JavaScript.</p>
<p>The 2nd week was spent integrating the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/RDFa/impl/js/">RDFa in Javascript</a> library by Ben Adida, Nathan Yergler, and Jeni Tennison, using it to parse and cache RDFa matadata while browsing web pages, creating a new tab in the Page Info dialog for this info to be shown. The changes in the code caused the need for a refactoring which I'm currently thinking of.</p>
<p>The current state of the project shows that its not too much effort left to start implementing the UI that was shown in the proposal.</p>
<h3>Contact details</h3>
<p>The project is hosted in the <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewgit/cc.ff_ext.git/"><abbr title="Creative Commons">CC</abbr> Code repository</a>, so you may always fetch and try the latest version of the extension (for example, using <code>wget http://code.creativecommons.org/viewgit/cc.ff_ext.git/plain/cc.ff_ext.xpi</code>).</p>
<p>I'll be pleased if anyone tries the extension, probably <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/issues/">reporting any issues</a>. It's generally useless now, however you may find it interesting to dig into the raw RDFa of web-sites. Anyway, I'd like to hear any opinions here in comments, on the <code>irc.freenode.net#cc</code> channel, by <a href="mailto:mail@igor.lukanin.name">email</a> or via <a title="jabber@igor.lukanin.name">Jabber</a>.</p>
