<p>Prompted by a <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/21809109">nudge</a> from <a href="http://evan.prodromou.name/">Evan Prodromou</a>, license badges and icons are now available via HTTPS on i.creativecommons.org.  If you run a site available via HTTPS and use CC license badges or icons served from i.creativecommons.org, then you can now pull those images via HTTPS to avoid your users receiving a message from their browser that some of the page content is not encrypted. </p>
