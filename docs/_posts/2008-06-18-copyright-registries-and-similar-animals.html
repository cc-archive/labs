<p>Rich Pearson - <a href="http://attributor.com/">Attributor.com</a></p>
<p>Attributor is aimed to be "A GPS for your content."  It provides a database matching service to detect licensed material on the web with accompanying data about its use (if there were ads on the page, how much was used, and how it was used).  It aims to be an interoperable and also open to all rights holders, multiple licenses, and associations.</p>

<p>Pierre Gerard - <a href="http://www.jamendo.com">Jamendo</a></p>
<p>Jamendo boasts that it is the biggest online free music community with over 10,000 albums under CC license including 300 new albums per week in over 60 countries. Consumers can pay if you wish for the content, usually $5 and Jamendo keeps 50cents.  Also, Jamendo shares advertising revenue along a 50/50 scheme with the artists.</p>

<p>Robert Kaye - <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">Music Brainz</a></p>
<p>Started MusicBrainz after the only other option was no longer available.  It aims to be a music metadata repository along with the ability to automatically tag personal music collections.  The way their metadata database is built is through community generated and corrected means.</p>

<p>Devon Copley - <a href="http://www.noankmedia.com/">Noank Media</a></p>
<p>Brings about a new way of dealing with licensing music online.  They are trying to be the in-between bargainer for Publishers and End Users enabling third party companies to buy blanket use of sets of songs for customers.  By doing this they fill the gap between CC+ and full copyright.  Their supported licenses include CC licenses, their own license, and public domain.</p>

<p>Joe Benso - <a href="http://www.registeredcommons.org/">Registered Commons</a></p>
<p>The Registered Commons service aims to provide a registery of digtal works of any kind while preferring CC licensed work.  They also time stamp each item and verify the author's identity.</p>
<p>---------</p>

<p>Javier Prenafeta - <a href="http://www.safecreative.org/">Safe Creative</a></p>
<p>This service allows authors to self register their works and do management of that data to ensure that a particular version of a work (image, video, audio) is associated with a specific license.  This enables users to have more confidence in the fact their use of a work is legally permissable.</p>

<p>Aaron Swartz - <a href="http://openlibrary.org/">OpenLibrary</a></p>
<p>The OpenLibrary aims to create one page for every book, ever.  This is done through a sort of wikipedia-style method by allowing users to modify metadata and correct mistakes.  Along with user supplied metadata the OpenLibrary is also given high quality information directly from publishers to insert into the database.</p>
