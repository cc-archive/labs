<p>Hubert Figuiere has <a href="http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/?2007/07/10/540-exempi-1993">released Exempi 1.99.3</a></p>
<p>An important addition in this release is the ability to serialize XMP to a string, making sidecar XMP possible.  The soon-to-be-released <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Liblicense">Liblicense</a> 0.1 already takes advantage of this feature; it uses Exempi to read and write licenses within XMP sidecar.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the API will soon stabilize in preparation for the 2.0 release.</p>
