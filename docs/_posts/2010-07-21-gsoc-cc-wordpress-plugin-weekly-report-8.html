<p>
This is a short one. This week, I did only a few things related to the <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/05/24/gsoc-project-introduction-cc-wordpress-plugin/">plugin</a>: First, planned features and bugs are now listed in <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/issues/issue?status=-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7&amp;@sort=-activity&amp;@search_text=&amp;@dispname=Wordpress%20CC%20Plugin&amp;@filter=status,project&amp;@group=priority&amp;project=29&amp;@columns=id,activity,title,creator,assignedto,status&amp;@pagesize=50&amp;@startwith=0">the issue tracker</a>. Second, you can now specify default attribution in the form of rights holder and URL. I did also work on the default licensing mechanism, but it probably needs a complete overhaul.</p>
<p>
For this week, I will be looking into more REST API stuff, get rid of the shortcodes so even with a deactivated plugin, there will still be content (parsing the elements Wordpress inserts instead, using DOM methods) and approach the mentioned rewrite of the default licensing mechanism.</p>
