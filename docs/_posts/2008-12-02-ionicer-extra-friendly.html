<p>We've discovered that some of our websites, in particular those that rely on MySQL, are very sensitive to spikes in disk I/O load. Right now, we do run some non-interactive services on the same machines as some of our websites.</p>
<p>Subversion and git in particular seem to cause long-duration high disk load, which causes Nathan Kinkade to get paged when e.g. wiki.creativecommons.org takes too long to load. We have found that using <a href="http://friedcpu.wordpress.com/2007/07/17/why-arent-you-using-ionice-yet/">ionice to set</a> background activities to "idle" priority is very useful in avoiding sending text messages to NK.</p>
<p>However, ionice can only be run by root, meaning regular users can't even request the system be more gentle. So I wrote a simple tool, "ionicer," that is a setuid-root C tool that sets its parent process's IO priority to idle.</p>
<p>You <a href="http://git.asheesh.org/?p=ionicer.git;a=summary">can check it out in my gitweb</a>.</p>
<p>I then used <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/118">dpkg-divert</a> to replace /usr/bin/svnserve and /usr/bin/git with simple shell wrappers that call ionicer before calling the real binaries.Â  So the call path goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>user connects with svn+ssh to code.creativecommons.org</li>
<li>user logs in with an SSH key and executes "svnserve."</li>
<li>svnserve is really a shell script. /bin/bash runs a script which does two things:
<ol>
<li>Runs ionicer, which changes the shell to I/O priority class idle, and</li>
<li>Executes svnserve.real with the same arguments as were passed into the wrapper.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ta-da!</p>
