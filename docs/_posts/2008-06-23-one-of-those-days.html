<p>I wake up in the morning to find that eternal funny man <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin#Death">George Carlin has died</a>. Add to that the fact that one of my recently-ported api tests has failed, and you just know it's going to be one of those days.</p>
<p>Work on porting the test suite was slow at first. I had thought it would be easy enough just to jump in and start coding. Later this pipe dream evaporated and I forced myself to learn CherryPy, Python Paste, and a bit of WSGI.Â  Then Asheesh and Nathan filled me in on the intricacies of the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout">"buildout" build system</a> (which is really quite nice when you get to know it), and I was ready to go.</p>
<p>So the porting has begun. Check out <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewsvn/api/branches/nose-test-suite-branch/">the branch</a> where all the fun is happening, if you happen to be so inclined. And as the fates would have it, the lucky number seventh test I ported just so happens to fail. This leads to the real challenge every software tester must eventually face: fixing a broken test. Getting to the bottom of this means a fun-filled day ahead.</p>
