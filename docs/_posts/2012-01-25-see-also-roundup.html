<p>The Learning Resource Metadata Initiative specification (which Creative Commons is coordinating) has entered its <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/31422">final public commenting period</a>. Please look if you're at all interested in education metadata and/or how efforts spurred by schema.org (which LRMI is) will shape up.</p>
<p>The W3C published drafts recently that ought be of great interest to the Creative Commons technology community: a <a href="http://www.w3.org/blog/SW/2012/01/11/feedback-welcome-an-overview-of-the-provenance-prov-family-of-specs/">family of documents regarding provenance</a> and a <a href="http://www.w3.org/blog/SW/2012/01/12/drafts-published-by-the-w3c-html-data-task-force-html-data-guide-and-microdata-to-rdf-transform/">guide to using microdata, microformats, and RDFa in HTML</a>. I mentioned these on my personal blog <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/12/penumbra-of-provenance/">here</a> and <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/12/html-data-guide/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of things mentioned on my personal blog, a couple days ago I posted <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/23/attribution-crawl/">some analysis of how people are deploying CC related metadata</a> based on a structured data extracted by the <a href="http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/muehleis/ccrdf/">Web Data Commons</a> project from a sample of the <a href="http://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> corpus. Earlier this month I posted a marginally technical <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/08/css-text-overlay-attribution/">explanation of using CSS text overlays to provide attribution</a> and a <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/01/10/open-hardware-licenses-history/">brief historical overview of 'open hardware licensing'</a>, something which the CC technology team hasn't been involved in, but is vaguely labs-ish, and needs deep technical attention.</p>
<p>Other things needing deep technical attention: <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0/Technical_protection_measures">how CC addresses Digital Restrictions Management in version 4.0 of its licenses</a> is being discussed. We don't know enough about the technical details of <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-licenses/2012-January/006663.html">various restricted systems</a> (see last sentence) that CC licensed works are being distributed on/to/with every day, and ought to. Another needs-technical-attention issue is <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0/Games_3d_printing_and_functional_content">'functional content'</a> for example in games and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/30605">3D printing</a>. And we're still <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/31227">looking for a new CTO</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Jonathan Rees just posted on <a href="https://odontomachus.wordpress.com/2012/01/25/how-to-apply-a-cc0-waiver-to-an-ontology/">how to apply CC0 to an ontology</a>. You should <a href="https://odontomachus.wordpress.com/">subscribe to Jonathan's blog</a> as almost every post is of great interest if you've read this far.</p>
<p><b>Addendum:</b> It seems remiss to not mention SOPA, so I'm adding it. <b>Thanks to the technology community</b> for rising up against this bad policy. CC promoted the campaign on its main website through banners and a number <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/30375">of</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/30836">blog</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/31286">posts</a>. Don't forget that SOPA/PIPA may well rise again, the so-called <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/31184">Research Works Act</a> is very different but is motivated by the same thinking, and ACTA threatens globally. Keep it up! In the long term, is not building a healthy commons (and thus technology needed to facilitate building a healthy commons) a big part of the solution? On that, see <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/12/anti-sopa-commons/">yet another post on my personal blog...</a></p>
