Thus, we assume that use the data, information and facts is open, but the arrangment can be protected.;In this case we we put 0 for policy available because even if there is a policy, it is not a policy about the use and redistribution and reformating of the database. We know that in the US data are free by default under Feist, but scientists may not know or even need to use the elements that are protected (arrangement...) so there is no legal certainty.
