	<h3>Statement of Purpose</h3>

	<p>The laws of various jurisdictions throughout the world
	automatically confer certain exclusive rights upon the creator
	of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a
	“Work”), and the subsequent owners thereof.</p>

	<p>Some owners of these exclusive rights wish to permanently
	remove these restrictions from a Work for the purpose of
	contributing to a commons that the public can reliably build
	upon, modify, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible
	from such restrictions for any purposes and in any form
	whatsoever, whether modified or unmodified, in whole or in
	part.  Such owners therefore wish to fully, permanently,
	irrevocably and unconditionally waive, abandon and relinquish
	their Copyright Related Rights (defined below) with respect to
	a Work to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

	<p>A Work associated with this CC0 Waiver may be protected by
	copyright and related or neighboring rights, database rights
	(such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European
	Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
	protection of databases, and under any national implementation
	thereof, (including any amended or successor version of such
	directive)), and/or other similar equivalent or corresponding
	rights throughout the world as such rights may be available
	under applicable law or treaty (and national implementations
	thereof), including but not limited to moral rights retained
	by the original author(s), publicity and privacy rights
	pertaining to an individual’s image or likeness depicted in a
	Work, rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
	to the Work, and any rights protecting the extraction,
	dissemination and reuse of data in the Work (such rights all,
	collectively, the “Copyright Related Rights”).</p>

	<p>The person associating this CC0 Waiver with a Work is the
	owner of Copyright Related Rights in the Work (the
	“Affirmer”), and does openly, overtly and voluntarily elect
	to apply this CC0 Waiver to his or her Work with knowledge of
	his or her Copyright Related Rights in the Work and the
	meaning and intended legal effect of this CC0 Waiver.</p>

	<p>Subject to rights of other persons in the Work, and any
	patent and trademark rights held by Affirmer, by associating
	this CC0 Waiver with a Work the Affirmer does intend to fully,
	permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waive, abandon
	and relinquish all of his or her Copyright Related Rights in
	such Work, to the fullest extent permitted by (but not in
	contravention of) applicable law.</p>


        <h3>CC0 Waiver</h3>

	<ol>
	  <li>To the fullest extent permitted by (but not in
	  contravention of) applicable law, Affirmer hereby fully,
	  permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
	  abandons and relinquishes all of Affirmer’s Copyright
	  Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action,
	  whether present or future, vested or contingent, in the
	  Work, (such waiver, abandonment, and relinquishment, the
	  "Waiver").  Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of
	  each member of the public at large and to the detriment of
	  Affirmer's heirs or successors.</li>

	  <li>Should the Waiver for any reason be judged legally
	  invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
	  shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted and
	  Affirmer hereby grants to each such affected recipient of
	  the Work a worldwide, royalty-free, non exclusive, perpetual
	  (for the duration of the applicable copyright), non
	  transferable, non sublicensable, irrevocable and
	  unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright
	  Related Rights in the Work, which license shall be deemed
	  effective as of the date this CC0 Waiver was applied by
	  Affirmer to the Work.</li>

	  <li>No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are
	  waived, abandoned, relinquished, licensed or otherwise
	  affected by this CC0 Waiver.</li>

	  <li>Affirmer hereby fully and completely disclaims
	  responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may
	  apply to the Work or any intended use thereof, including
	  without limitation any such person’s Copyright Related
	  Rights (including privacy and publicity rights).  Further,
	  Affirmer hereby fully and completely disclaims
	  responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
	  permissions or other rights required for such intended
	  use.</li>

	  <li>Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative
	  Commons is not party to this CC0 Waiver and has no duty or
	  obligation with respect to this CC0 Waiver or use of the
	  Work. </li>
