The idea here is to have some common place for code for dealing with 
CC licensing that can be re-used in many different places. Currently, this
is spread all over, so now we can hopefully start to locate it all together.

To create a new place for your code, like something in JAVA, please create
a new folder with the simple name for the language, like /java. Then, start
throwing your code in there...let's go!
