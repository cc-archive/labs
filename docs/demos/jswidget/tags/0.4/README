in the form of a JavaScript widget.

Web browsers can only be expected to load a single file from us.

The code is structured as follows:
* An HTML page includes complete.js, which PHP renders
** they can pass a variable on the query string to set the language, which is why we involve PHP
** an alternate design would be to include different static files: complete.en.js, etc.
* complete.js loads the CSS and static JS files that hardly change
* complete.js loads template.js.var (for Apache Content Negotiation to pick a language) or template.js.LANG_ID if a language was specified

All of our JS and HTML and CSS is prefixed with cc_js_ to avoid 
namespace collisions with others' applications.
